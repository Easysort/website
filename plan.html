    <h3>Situation:</h3>
    <p>In 2024, Denmark has incinerated over 3 million tons of residual waste, resulting in 1.7 million tons of CO₂ emissions. 
        This marks an 8% increase over the past five years and a 34% rise over the last fifteen years. These increases persist 
        despite multiple European Union regulations and the Danish government's ambitions to reduce emissions. <br>
        The Danish target is to decrease CO₂ emissions from 1.7 million tons to 0.5 million tons over the next ten years. 
        As of right now, all Danish waste sorting is entirely up to the citizens. Why? 
        Because politicans don't believe this technology exists. Easysort is here to prove them wrong! LFG!</p>

    <h3>Main Issues in this sector:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Low Sorting Purity</b>: It is extremely challenging to ensure that everyone sorts their trash with the purity necessary for effective recycling.</li>
        <li><b>Unsorted Residual Waste</b>: Residual waste in Denmark, regardless of its source, is not sorted. When waste purity is insufficient or residual waste remains unsorted, it is burned, releasing CO₂.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Vision:</h3>
    <p>We envision a new future with as little human waste sorting as possible. Sorting waste is not only frustrating, it's also expensive in time for citizens, in money for the municipalities and at time ineffective[1]. 
        We want robots to sort as much waste as possible saving money, time and waste from being burned.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Solution:</h3>
    <p>We act as a middleman between the residual waste from companies and the burning facilities. Our services for companies and organizations involve:
        <li><b>Collection</b>: Either they deliver or we pickup residual waste and transport to our central facility.</li>
        <li><b>Robotic Sorting</b>: Advanced robots sort the waste with high precision.</li>
        <li><b>Distribution</b>: Sorted materials are returned to suppliers and integrated into new products through existing transportation lines by vendors such as Marius Pedersen or Stena Recycling.</li>
        This way we reduce the amount of waste burned thereby saving huge amounts of CO₂.
        </p>

    <h3>Value proposition:</h3>
    <p>So why should companies buy? And how do we make money?</p>
    <p>When talking to customers, many of them do want to take better care of their waste. The main issues for them are: time to set it up, having to built a team and not spending a fortune. We aim to resolve all three.</p>
    <p>Our service is as easy to set up as can be. For companies, as soon as they pay us, the solution is implemented. They either redirect their usual garbage trucks, or we pay vendors to deliver their waste to us. 
        This is all the customer has to do. No team or specialized personnel is required.</p>
    <p>When it comes to money, our prices can slightly undercut that of burning the waste. This is possible because of high taxes on burning waste. As we can sort waste at extremely high purities, 
        this too is valuable for recycling plants and manufactures, who are willing to pay us. About 40% of the revenue will be from customers, with the other 60% being from selling sorted waste.</p>
    <p>This gives us an extremely appealing and strong value proposition: <b>Save CO₂, strengthen your online profile to customers all while saving money.</b></p>

    <h3>This already exists?!</h3>
    <p>Partly yes, partly no. Let's have a look at other companies.</p>
    <p>In Norway and Netherlands large facilities sorting all kinds of waste exist. The issue is that traditional methods have a hard time keeping purity high.</p>
    <p>Two other companies in the UK (Recycleeye, GreyParrot) and one here in Denmark (Aris) are the most direct competitors. They are either focusing on industry waste or pharmaceuticals and 
        only offer once side of the equation: the software. This is different from our approach; We do the sorting for companies, and we focus directly on residual waste in public and office spaces.</p>

    <h3>Current status (11 Feb 2025):</h3>
    <p>Through a targeted market research, we got in contact with 13 companies of which 7 showed interest. Of these 7 companies, 2 would want to run a pilot project within 6 months, while another 2 signed Letters of Intent showcasing their interest, the more significant one being DTU Campus Service.</p>
    <p>We have developed a demo robot to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution. It is through this demo we got a Micro Grant of 50.000 DKK to develop our production testing robot. We are currently building this robot suitable for real-world testing with companies. 
        This coming phase will help us gather data, identify issues, and perfect our solution. The first pilot project with DTU Campus Service will be on the 1st of April.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Roadmap:</h3>
    <p>The next 6 months are all about preparing and successfully running a pilot project with DTU Campus Service. To do so we need to first test our current robot, find the most important limitations and resolve those. </p>
    <p>We are actively looking for funding to accelerate our timeline. We have customers ready to test our solution, but we need to make sure it's ready. If you are hyped by this approach to future waste sorting, please contact us!</p>

    <h3>Skilled people needed:</h3>
    <p>If you are skilled and hyped by our approach, you have a chance to join the founding team. We are mainly looking for mechatronical engineers (electrical, mechanical), 
        and we are always on the lookout for talented people in other fields. Contact me at lucas@easysort.org.</p>
