                <h2>Situation</h2>
                <p class="highlight-text">In 2024, Denmark has incinerated over 3 million tons of residual waste, resulting in 1.7 million tons of CO₂ emissions.</p>
                <p>This marks an 8% increase over the past five years and a 34% rise over the last fifteen years. These increases persist 
                despite multiple European Union regulations and the Danish government's ambitions to reduce emissions.</p>
                <p>The Danish target is to decrease CO₂ emissions from 1.7 million tons to 0.5 million tons over the next ten years. 
                As of right now, all Danish waste sorting is entirely up to the citizens. Why? 
                Because politicans don't believe this technology exists. Easysort is here to prove them wrong!</p>

                <p class="highlight-text">We want robots to sort as much waste as possible saving money, time and waste from being burned.</p>

                        <p>Our prices can slightly undercut that of burning waste. This is possible because of high taxes on burning waste. As we can sort waste at extremely high purities, this too is valuable for recycling plants and manufactures.</p>
