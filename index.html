  <h2 id="easysort">Easysort</h2>
  <p> <a href="https://github.com/easysort/easysort">Easysort</a> is going to be complete sorting software to sort recyclables 
    from a stream of residual waste.</p>

  <p>Place a camera of at least 1080p above a conveyor belt, connect it to a computer, raspberry PI or esp32, and run Easysort on it.
    Easysort will automatically detect objects in the feed. </p>
  <p>A standard mapping from item to sorting bin is provided,
    but this can be modified to fit any sorting system. This is most likely needed if you are not in Denmark.
    Out comes pickup positions with deticated bins attached. We provide a default connector to connect to an arduino/esp32 like controller, which most robots use.

  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>In 2024, Denmark has incinerated over 3 million tons of residual waste, resulting in 1.8 million tons of CO₂ emissions. 
    This marks an 8% increase over the past five years and a 34% rise over the last fifteen years. 
    These increases persist despite multiple European Union regulations and the Danish government's ambitions to reduce emissions. 
    The Danish target is to decrease CO₂ emissions from 1.7 million tons to 0.5 million tons over the next ten years.</p>
  <p>Some countries (including Denmark) have chosen to entirely rely on humans to sort waste themselves. This is frustrating for the population and extremely ineffective.</p>
  <p><b>Main Issues in the Sector</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Low Sorting Purity:</b> It is extremely challenging to ensure that everyone sorts their trash with the purity necessary for effective recycling.</li>
    <li><b>Unsorted Residual Waste:</b> Residual waste in Denmark, regardless of its source, is not sorted. When waste purity is insufficient or residual waste remains unsorted, it is burned, releasing CO₂.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Easysort aims to solve this problem by maintaining a complete software for sorting recyclables from residual waste and providing it freely for everyone.</p>
  <p>Building the robots themselves are secondary and only relevant once the software has proven itself to work effectively.</p>

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <dl class="faqtable">
    <dt>How good is easysort?</dt>
    <dd> - Easysort should be stable to run and accurate. It's not yet ready for production, but it's getting there. Investigate our <a href="https://github.com/easysort/easysort">github</a> if you want to know more.</dd>

    <dt>How does easysort make money?</dt>
    <dd> - We run a service where we sort waste for companies and sell the sorted waste to recycling companies.</dd>

    <dt>I can find the software, but I can't find the hardware?</dt>
    <dd> - The software of Easysort is freely available. Our retired robots will be open-source. Building the robots is secondary, and we therefore have nothing to share yet.</dd> 

    <dt>When will EasySort leave alpha?</dt>
    <dd> - When Easysort can correctly categorize >90% of the waste items shown to it with a minimum speed of 2 s/iteration.</dd>

    <dt>Where is easysort development happening?</dt>
    <dd> - On Github.</dd>

    <dt>What's the goal of easysort?</dt>
    <dd> - To decrease the amount of reusable waste burned towards 0 by making sorting software easy to implement and free to use.</dd>

    <dt>Can I work for Easysort?</dt>
    <dd> - Check out our <a href="challenges.html">challenges for potentiel hires and bounties for contributors</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Can you help me sort our waste?</dt>
    <dd> - Yes! We are looking for companies to sort waste for. Contact me at lucas@easysort.org.</dd>
